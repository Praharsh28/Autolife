00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's venture into the core of our so-
called choices are

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
orchestrated by subconscious processes
 beyond our control. Neurological studies
 reveal

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
that our brains initiate decisions
 milliseconds before we become aware

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of them. Consciousness is not the captain,
 but the spokesperson

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
narrating a story written behind the
 scenes. We're essentially observers,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
not originators of our actions.

# Implementation Instructions and Solutions

This document tracks the implementation details, solutions, and instructions for each improvement made to the Autolife Media Processing Application.

## Error Handling and Recovery

### 1. Network Failure Retry Mechanism
#### Implementation Details
- Added exponential backoff retry strategy
- Implemented error categorization (retryable vs non-retryable errors)
- Added connection pooling with requests.Session
- Implemented configurable timeouts (connect, read, total)
- Added jitter to retry delays to prevent thundering herd
- Implemented request tracking and logging

#### Testing Steps
1. Test API calls with:
   - Network disconnection
   - Slow network response
   - Connection timeouts
   - Read timeouts
   - Server 5xx errors
   - Rate limiting responses

2. Verify retry behavior:
   - Exponential backoff timing
   - Maximum retry limits
   - Error logging
   - Success after retry

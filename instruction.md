Instruction Manual for Modularizing the Application and Implementing Features
Introduction

This instruction manual is designed for an AI code editor to help refactor the existing Python application into a modular structure and to implement future features efficiently. The goal is to enhance code maintainability, scalability, and to ensure that changes are made systematically without affecting unrelated parts of the application.

Modularization of the Code
Project Structure

Restructure the project to organize code into modules and packages. The recommended directory layout is:

your_project/
├── modules/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── file_list_widget.py
│   ├── workers/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── subtitle_worker.py
│   │   └── srt_to_ass_worker.py
│   ├── main_window.py
│   ├── utilities.py
│   └── constants.py
├── resources/
│   ├── styles/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── logs/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md

Splitting Code into Modules

    Custom Widgets: Move FileListWidget class into modules/file_list_widget.py.

    Workers:
        SubtitleWorker and WorkerSignals go into modules/workers/subtitle_worker.py.
        SrtToAssWorker and associated signals go into modules/workers/srt_to_ass_worker.py.

    Main Application Window: Move MainWindow class into modules/main_window.py.

    Utilities and Constants:
        Place helper functions, constants, and configurations into modules/utilities.py and modules/constants.py.

    Resources: Keep stylesheets, templates, and logs in the resources/ directory.

Updating Imports

After reorganizing the code, update all import statements to reflect the new structure. Use relative imports within the modules package.

For example, in main_window.py:

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow
from .file_list_widget import FileListWidget
from .workers.subtitle_worker import SubtitleWorker
from .workers.srt_to_ass_worker import SrtToAssWorker
# Other necessary imports

Main Entry Point

Create a main.py file as the entry point of the application:

import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
from modules.main_window import MainWindow

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = MainWindow()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

Good Coding Practices for Feature Implementation
Implement One Feature at a Time

    Isolation: Focus on one feature or bug fix per development session.
    Modular Changes: Modify only the modules related to the feature.
    Testing: After implementing, test the feature thoroughly before moving on.

Confirm Changes with the User

    User Approval: Before making changes that affect existing features or the overall structure, ask for user confirmation.
    Feedback Loop: After implementing the feature, present the changes and ask if any adjustments are needed.

Maintain Code Consistency

    Code Style: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
    Naming Conventions: Use clear and consistent names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.
    Refactoring: When improving code, ensure it doesn't introduce regressions or alter existing functionality without reason.

Documentation and Comments

    Docstrings: Include docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions explaining their purpose and usage.
    Inline Comments: Use comments to clarify complex logic or important decisions in the code.
    README Updates: Update the README.md file with any new features or changes that impact the user.

Error Handling and Logging

    Exceptions: Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.
    Logging: Implement logging to record significant events, errors, and exceptions.
    User Notifications: Inform the user of errors or important events via the application's interface.

Instructions for the AI Code Editor
Change Management

    Atomic Changes: Make changes in small, manageable increments to make reviewing and testing easier.
    Version Control: Use a version control system like Git to track changes. Commit after each significant change with a clear message.
    Backup: Before making changes, ensure there is a backup or the ability to revert if needed.

User Interaction Protocol

    Prompt Before Changes: Before modifying a module or implementing a new feature, present a summary of the intended changes and get user approval.
    Ask for Clarification: If any instructions are ambiguous, ask the user for clarification before proceeding.
    Post-Change Review: After making changes, provide a summary of what was altered and ask the user to review and confirm.

Code Style Guidelines

    Consistency: Ensure that the new code follows the same style and conventions as the existing codebase.
    Imports: Organize imports logically, grouping standard library imports, third-party imports, and local imports separately.
    Type Annotations: Use type hints where appropriate to improve code clarity and assist with debugging.

Conclusion

By following this instruction manual, the AI code editor will help maintain a clean and efficient codebase, facilitate future development, and ensure that new features are added without disrupting existing functionality. This approach enhances collaboration between the user and the AI, leading to a more productive development process.

Note to the AI Code Editor: Please adhere strictly to the guidelines provided. Before implementing any feature or making significant changes, ensure that you have confirmed the plan with the user. This will help prevent unintended modifications and maintain the integrity of the application.

Appendices
Appendix A: Sample Module Structure
modules/file_list_widget.py

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QListWidget, QAbstractItemView
# Additional imports if necessary

class FileListWidget(QListWidget):
    # Existing code for FileListWidget
    pass

modules/workers/subtitle_worker.py

from PyQt5.QtCore import QThread, pyqtSignal, QObject
# Additional imports if necessary

class WorkerSignals(QObject):
    # Existing code for WorkerSignals
    pass

class SubtitleWorker(QThread):
    # Existing code for SubtitleWorker
    pass

modules/main_window.py

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow
from .file_list_widget import FileListWidget
from .workers.subtitle_worker import SubtitleWorker
# Additional imports if necessary

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    # Existing code for MainWindow
    pass

Appendix B: Code Style Essentials

    Indentation: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
    Line Length: Limit lines to 79 characters.
    Encoding: Use UTF-8 encoding.
    Quotes: Use single quotes ' for strings unless the string contains a single quote, then use double quotes ".

Appendix C: Sample User Interaction

AI Editor: "I plan to refactor the SubtitleWorker into its own module subtitle_worker.py within the modules/workers/ directory. This will involve moving the class definition and updating imports in other modules. Do you approve this change?"

User: "Yes, please proceed."

AI Editor: "Refactoring complete. The SubtitleWorker is now in modules/workers/subtitle_worker.py. Imports have been updated accordingly. Please review the changes."
Appendix D: Testing Procedures

    Unit Tests: Write tests for individual functions and classes.
    Integration Tests: Ensure that modules interact correctly.
    Manual Testing: Run the application and manually test new features and existing functionality.
